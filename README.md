# SVM_Novelty_Detection
## Files
* [Main notebook "One_Class_SVM_Novelty_Detection.ipynb"]
* [Images]


## Requirements. Setup
* Please download in the same place as the notebook https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lwktG1FbJLjKpiPs-VpC4DuofmKtJcyv/view?usp=sharing 
* Please go to the command prompt and **pip install cvxopt**	
* If you use Jupyter Notebook, I recommend you not to run all the cells(I highlighted when) because it might take a lot of time and you will not be able to finish in 1h. Instead if you work in GoogleColab you can run.

## Compulsory
* Enjoy!
